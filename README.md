## recurring questions:
--------------------------------------- documentation| 
+ should i describe more things about the details *also* in use cases? or should most of them be specified in the "functional items"?
+ should "rules" be written in the functional items? if so, is the fact that the game must allow these rules a Qualitative aspect or an informative aspect?
+ Should i write in both fields, specifying in the "informative items" WHAT the system will be capable of doing and in the        "qualitative items" WHAT THAT IMPLIES?
  eg.
   - IIN: every turn will have these phases:
          draw phase, main phase, battle phase...
   - QI: a turn will last up to 30 seconds, allowing the user to play 1 card normally and 0 or more if a card effect that allows it       is activated
  if that is the case, what about the _details_ of the phases of each turn?



most importantly: do any of these questions matter?
